### Work on tomorrow
- Maybe locking persistence first
- Scheduling?
- Add a way to pass a config file into the daemon to start it
- Write unit and integration tests for almost every use case for more efficient workflow

### Get to eventually
- There are a few more things that I would like the landing page for the blocker to display. It should give which block is preventing the current website, or multiple. And also if the block is blocking because of a scudule.
- Listing blocks should display if they are schedule or not, but won't actually display the full schedule. That will be done with schedule list

### Things I'll have AI do:
- Write the README.md file

### 8/11/2025
- Today I worked on refactoring a bit, and getting the linux installation working.
- Separated WORKLOG and README


### 8/12/2025
- Combined daemon and cli into one for better commands
