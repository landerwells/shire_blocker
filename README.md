MVP
- Config file
- Commands for CLI

Need to come up with a fame for it at some point.

Goals of this project
- Only support Firefox (possibly Safari at some point)
- Cross-platform (Linux and MacOS)
- Text based configuration (would consider a UI later)
- CLI would also be able to control commands and start blocks
- Support for NixOS, Homebrew, and cargo installations

Features I would consider adding
- Do not disturb mode for mac
- Specifying an additional configuration file to read if there are blocks that you want to keep private
